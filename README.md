# proyectoDeTecfnologia
Proyecto de programación para la clase de tecnología
This project is a program that I have created for the technology class where we talked about security in social networks, so I wanted to do, with the help of my programming 
knowledge, make a simple program that would allow the user to implement security in instagram, in this case, automatically. The project is written in python using the tkinter 
and selenium library, and used object-oriented programming.
